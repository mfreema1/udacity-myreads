# MyReads Udacity React Project

This is the first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree.  It involves simple
React fundamentals such as setting state and managing components and properties.
This is currently being used as a stepping stone to get into more advanced React
projects in the near future.

To run this application, simply clone to your machine, `cd` into the directory,
and use `npm install` to get the required node modules.  Then, use `npm start` to
open the application.
